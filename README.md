## Install Guide

### Prerequisites
You must have an Android device (or emulator) with SDK level 21. This is equivalent to Android 5.0. You also must have an internet connection and space on your device for our app.

### Download and Install
To download our app, go into the Google Play Store. Search for Campus Safari. Download the app onto your phone. When it is downloaded, it should be ready to run.

### Troubleshooting
**I cannot find the app on the Google Play Store.**
Due to COVID-19, Google is taking longer than usual to approve apps to be displayed in the Play Store. Wait a few days and then check back and it should be there.

**I have downloaded the app but the map won't display.**
Make sure you have enabled locations permissions for the app. Without those permissions, we can not display the map.
